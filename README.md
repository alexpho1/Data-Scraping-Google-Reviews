# Data-Scraping-Google-Reviews
Scraping Reviews for a local business on Google Reviews
This is a piece of a group project that I did with another group of students. The project was to conduct sentiment analysis of a local restaraunt absed on reviews from varying sources. This code in particular was used for Google Reviews.
The libraries used were Beautiful Soup and Selenium for python and visualizations were created in Tableau.
